# rl-js-agents (add badges here)

Code for [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) agents, written in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

This is a [`node`](https://nodejs.org) module that will be made available via GitHub and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Check dependencies and `engines`, etc. in `package.json`; this module targets the current LTS, and possibly higher versions.

Since nothing has been published to `npm` so far, to start hacking: clone this repo with `git` and therein run `npm install`.

Use `npm test` to run the standard (fast) test suite; `npm run report` will generate a comprehensive test artifact.

Versioning follows [`semver`](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) with odd-numbered minor versions for development releases.

The project welcomes PRs with continuous integration and [greenkeeper.io](https://greenkeeper.io/), among other great tools.

Our style is `prettier` and `standard`, enforced through `eslint`. Please configure your editor of choice accordingly.

Read `package.json`, `.eslint*` and other configuration files for more details. Happy hacking!
